### Hola, Mundo.

I'm an aspiring software engineer from New York and currently an MCIT candidate @UPenn.

🤝 Let's collaborate! I'm most comfortable with Java and Python, but I'm interested in Web and Mobile development, as well.
📚 Currently learning: data structures and algorithms in Java, React + full-stack JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
